Hello!

Thank you for downloading my asset pack, and I wish you the best 
of luck with it.

The animations are divided into two folders, 'Strips' and 'Gifs'.
Use whichever is easier to import into your project.

The png 'Full Sprite Sheet' is full of every animation for chests,
player, and enemy. Note, item animations aren't included in this
file for neatness, and the strips they are animated on they just
hover up and down. If you still want the hover animations, they
are included in the 'Strips' or 'Gifs' Folder. 

The files 'Guide' and 'ItchThumbnail' are for reference, not use,
as they have blown up sprites by about tenfold. 

'GuiHeader' is pretty self explanatory. 

If you have any issues or suggestions, I would be happy to take them,
here's some ways you can contact me:

email   - fishagoodwin@gmail.com
itch.io - just use the page you downloaded this from to comment.
